# ADS816x ADC Control Core

The `shim_ads816x_adc_ctrl` module implements command-driven control for the Texas Instruments ADS816x ADC family (ADS8168, ADS8167, ADS8166) in the Rev D shim firmware. It handles SPI transactions, command sequencing, sample ordering, error detection, and synchronization for up to 8 ADC channels.

## Supported Devices

- ADS8168 (`ADS_MODEL_ID = 8`)
- ADS8167 (`ADS_MODEL_ID = 7`)
- ADS8166 (`ADS_MODEL_ID = 6`)

Set the target device using the `ADS_MODEL_ID` parameter.

## State Machine

The state machine in `shim_ads816x_adc_ctrl` uses the following codes:

| State Code | Name         | Description                                                                 |
|:----------:|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`        | `S_RESET`    | Reset state; waits for `resetn` deassertion.                                |
| `1`        | `S_INIT`     | Initialization; starts SPI register write for boot test.                    |
| `2`        | `S_TEST_WR`  | Boot test: writes On-The-Fly mode to ADC register.                          |
| `3`        | `S_REQ_RD`   | Boot test: requests readback of On-The-Fly register.                        |
| `4`        | `S_TEST_RD`  | Boot test: reads back register value and checks for match.                  |
| `5`        | `S_IDLE`     | Idle; waits for new command from buffer.                                    |
| `6`        | `S_DELAY`    | Delay timer; waits for specified cycles before next command.                |
| `7`        | `S_TRIG_WAIT`| Waits for external trigger signal.                                          |
| `8`        | `S_ADC_RD`   | Performs ADC read sequence for all channels.                                |
| `9`        | `S_ADC_RD_CH`| Immediately and simply read a single ADC channel.                           |
| `10`       | `S_LOOP`     | Loop state; manages command repetition.                                     |
| `15`       | `S_ERROR`    | Error state; indicates boot/readback failure or invalid command/condition.  |

State transitions are managed based on command type, trigger, delay, and error conditions.

### Boot Test

If `boot_test_skip` is asserted, boot-time SPI register test is skipped and `setup_done` is set immediately. The core transitions directly from `S_RESET` to `S_IDLE`.

Otherwise, the core performs a boot test by writing to the On-The-Fly mode register and reading it back to verify correct operation. If the readback does not match the expected value, the core transitions to `S_ERROR`.

The boot test sequence is as follows:

1. **`S_RESET -> S_INIT`**: After exiting reset, the core prepares to write the On-The-Fly mode register.

2. **`S_INIT -> S_TEST_WR`**: Writes the On-The-Fly mode command to the ADC.
  - SPI command composition:
    - `[23:19]` = `00001` (SPI register write command)
    - `[18:8]`  = `00000101010` (address for On-The-Fly mode register, `0x2A`)
    - `[7:0]`   = `00000001` (data to set On-The-Fly mode)
  - SPI word written:
    ```
    00001_00000101010_00000001
    0x082A01
    ```

3. **`S_TEST_WR -> S_REQ_RD`**: After write completion, requests readback of the On-The-Fly mode register.
  - SPI command composition:
    - `[23:19]` = `00010` (SPI register read command)
    - `[18:8]`  = `00000101010` (address for On-The-Fly mode register, `0x2A`)
    - `[7:0]`   = `00000000` (data field, unused for read)
  - SPI word written:
    ```
    00010_00000101010_00000000
    0x102A00
    ```

4. **`S_REQ_RD -> S_TEST_RD`**: After read request completion, reads back the register value by writing a 16-bit dummy command to clock out the read data.
  - SPI command composition:
    - `[15:0]` = `0000000000000000` (dummy command; all zeros)
  - SPI word written:
    ```
    0000000000000000
    0x0000
    ```
  - SPI response composition:
    - `[15:8]` = `00000001` (should match the On-The-Fly mode value written earlier)
    - `[7:0]`  = `00000000` (unused)
  - SPI response expected (MISO):
    ```
    00000001_00000000
    0x0100
    ```

5. **`S_TEST_RD -> S_IDLE`**: If readback matches expected value, setup is complete (`setup_done` is set); otherwise, transitions to `S_ERROR` and sets `boot_fail`.


## Operation

The core operates based on 32-bit command words read from the command buffer. Each command is executed fully before the next is read (except for CANCEL, which can interrupt waits).

### Command Types

- **NO_OP (`3'd0`)**: Delay or trigger wait.
- **SET_ORD (`3'd1`)**: Set sample order for ADC channels.
- **ADC_RD (`3'd2`)**: Read ADC samples.
- **ADC_RD_CH (`3'd3`)**: Read specific ADC channel.
- **LOOP (`3'd4`)**: Loop command.
- **CANCEL (`3'd7`)**: Cancel current wait or delay.

### Command Word Structure

- `[31:29]` — Command code (3 bits).
#### NO_OP (`3'd0`)
- `[28]` — **TRIGGER WAIT**: If set, waits for external trigger (`trigger` input); otherwise, uses value as delay timer.
- `[27]` — **CONTINUE**: If set, expects next command immediately after current completes; if not, returns to IDLE unless buffer underflow.
- `[24:0]` — **Value**: If TRIGGER WAIT is set, this is the trigger counter (number of triggers to wait for); otherwise, it is the delay timer (number of clock cycles to wait, zero is allowed).

This command does not initiate SPI activity. If TRIGGER WAIT is set, the core waits for the specified number of external trigger events. Otherwise, it waits for the delay timer to expire. The trigger counter represents the exact number of triggers to wait for, so a value of 0 means finish immediately (no triggers), and a value of 1 means wait for one trigger. The core transitions to the next command if present; if CONTINUE is set and there is no next command, it goes to ERROR, otherwise returns to IDLE.

**State transitions:**
- `S_IDLE -> S_TRIG_WAIT/S_DELAY -> S_IDLE/S_ERROR/next_cmd_state`

#### SET_ORD (`3'd1`)
- `[23:21]` — Channel 7 index
- `[20:18]` — Channel 6 index
- `[17:15]` — Channel 5 index
- `[14:12]` — Channel 4 index
- `[11:9]`  — Channel 3 index
- `[8:6]`   — Channel 2 index
- `[5:3]`   — Channel 1 index
- `[2:0]`   — Channel 0 index

Configures sample order for subsequent ADC_RD commands. Default order is 0–7. The command is processed in one cycle; the core transitions to the next command if present, otherwise to IDLE.

**State transitions:**
- `S_IDLE -> S_IDLE/next_cmd_state`

#### ADC_RD (`3'd2`)
- `[28]` — **TRIGGER WAIT**
- `[27]` — **CONTINUE**
- `[24:0]` — **Value**: If TRIGGER WAIT is set, this is the trigger counter (number of triggers to wait for) after ADC read; otherwise, it is the delay timer (number of clock cycles to wait after ADC read, zero is allowed).

Initiates an ADC read sequence for 8 channels in the configured order. In On-The-Fly mode, the core sends 8 SPI words of the form `{2'b10, ch, 11'd0}` (where `ch` is the channel index), followed by a dummy word to clock out the last sample (total 9 transactions). Each MISO word returns the sample for the previously requested channel (first word is garbage). After all samples are read, the core either waits for the specified number of triggers or delay cycles, depending on the TRIGGER WAIT flag. The trigger counter represents the exact number of triggers to wait for, so a value of 0 means finish immediately (no triggers), and a value of 1 means wait for one trigger. The core then transitions to the next command or IDLE/ERROR.

**State transitions:**
- `S_IDLE -> S_ADC_RD -> S_TRIG_WAIT/S_DELAY -> S_IDLE/S_ERROR/next_cmd_state`

#### ADC_RD_CH (`3'd3`)
- `[2:0]` — **Channel**: ADC channel to read (0-7)

Immediately and simply reads a single given ADC channel.  Has no delays or trigger waits after completion.

**State transitions:**
- `S_IDLE -> S_ADC_RD_CH -> S_IDLE/next_cmd_state`

#### LOOP (`3'd4`)
- `[24:0]` — **Loop count**: Number of times to repeat the next command

Sets up a loop for the next command. The next command will be repeated the specified number of times.

**State transitions:**
- `S_IDLE -> S_LOOP_NEXT -> S_IDLE/S_ERROR/next_cmd_state`

#### CANCEL (`3'd7`)
- `[28:0]` — Unused.

Cancels the current wait or delay if issued while the core is in DELAY or TRIG_WAIT state (or just finishing ADC_RD, about to transition to one of those). This is the only command that can interrupt a wait. After canceling, the core returns to IDLE.

**State transitions:**
- `S_TRIG_WAIT/S_DELAY/S_ADC_RD -> S_IDLE`


## Data Buffer Output

### ADC Samples

During and shortly after the `S_ADC_RD` state, the core receives 16-bit ADC samples on MISO. The samples are packed by pairs into 32-bit words for output to the data buffer. For a pair of samples (N, N+1), the output word is formatted as 
```
[data_word] = {sample N+1 [15:0], sample N [15:0]}
```

### Debug Mode
If `debug` is asserted, the core outputs debug information in addition to ADC samples. On a given clock cycle, the core will choose what to output in the following priority order:
1. If an ADC sample pair is ready, output that.
2. If a state transition occurs, output a word using Debug Code 2 (`DBG_STATE_TRANSITION`), including the previous and current state.
3. If the chip select timer starts, output a word using Debug Code 3 (`DBG_N_CS_TIMER`), including the timer value.
4. If the SPI bit counter changes from 0 to nonzero, output a word using Debug Code 4 (`DBG_SPI_BIT`), including the SPI bit value.
5. If a MISO data word is read during boot test, output a word using Debug Code 1 (`DBG_MISO_DATA`), including the MISO data.

Debug output format:
- `[31:28]` - Debug Code (see below)
- Remaining bits: debug data (varies by code, see below)

| Debug Code | Name                   | Data Format                                 |
|:----------:|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| 1          | `DBG_MISO_DATA`        | `[15:0]` MISO data                          |
| 2          | `DBG_STATE_TRANSITION` | `[7:4]` prev_state, `[3:0]` state           |
| 3          | `DBG_N_CS_TIMER`       | `[7:0]` n_cs_timer value                    |
| 4          | `DBG_SPI_BIT`          | `[4:0]` spi_bit value                       |

If none of the above conditions are met, the output word is zero and nothing is written to the data buffer.

## Errors

- Boot readback mismatch (`boot_fail`)
- Unexpected trigger (trigger when not in `S_TRIG_WAIT`) (`unexp_trig`)
- Invalid commands (`bad_cmd`)
- Buffer underflow (expect next command with command buffer empty) (`cmd_buf_underflow`)
- Buffer overflow (try to write to data buffer with data buffer full) (`data_buf_overflow`)

## Notes

- SPI timing and chip select are managed to meet ADS816x requirements.
- The `n_cs_high_time` input is latched when the state machine is in `S_RESET` to ensure stable timing parameters throughout operation.
- Asynchronous FIFO and synchronizer modules are used for safe cross-domain data transfer.
- Data buffer output is packed as two samples per 32-bit word.
